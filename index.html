        <b>Everyone keeps on saying that school life is the best time of your life. When listening to these phrases from their elders, the school students think about what is good about this life. All we do in the entire day is to attend the classes and to do the homework. But once school life gets over, the students realise that school life was the best time of their life.Apart from learning great things in school, you make new friends, play different sports and create memories for the rest of your life.The students also learn many life skills like teamwork, good manners, etc., and understand what they want to become in their life.</b>
